StupidProject
=============

These are the files for my implementation of the StupidModel using Repast. While the model appears to have full 
functionality, I will be practicing my verification skills by ensuring that my code implememnts the proper StupidModel
formulation. There are still some questions littered in the comments; most are about other ways to approach the problem.

Note: the code does not match the smaple code, as I did not exactly follow the tutorial.
